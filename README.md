<br>

**Project Overview**<br>
For this project, you'll be building a portfolio website. You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and you must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of your Nanodegree program. Please note that while you should aim to recreate the mockup, you may also use your own custom images to personalize this project.<br>

Once you've successfully replicated the design mockup, you are encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it your own! This is your living portfolio site, so make sure you're happy with it.<br>

**Learning outcomes?**<br>
You will learn how HTML is used to define the content of a web page and start to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen. You’ll then learn how to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.<br>

You'll accomplish this while conforming to a style guide which is an important constraint once you step into any existing development position.<br>

**Instructions:**<br>
1. Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section (in the lower corner of your screen, just below this text) and review it.
2. Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
3. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
4. Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
5. Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators. Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas           Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:
    HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
    CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box- sizing).

**PROJECT SPECIFICATION**<br>

**Design**<br>
Required Elements<br>

The page at minimum includes all of the following:<br>

-at least 4 images<br>
-title text (h1, h2, etc.)<br>
-regular (paragraph) text<br>
-a logo.<br>

*Semantic HTML*<br>

-HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` etc. are used to add meaning to the code.<br>
-No `<div>` or `<section>` tags are without a CSS class or id.<br>
-Check out the W3C documentation on HTML Structural Elements to learn more!<br>
  
*Provide at least one of the following customizations:*<br>

-Customize images and text.<br>
-Customize placement of the elements on the page (grid layout) with HTML, CSS or both.<br>
-Customize CSS styles applied at minimum to paragraph and heading elements.<br>

*Grid-Based Layout*<br>
Page utilizes a grid-based layout with styles making use of the flexbox layout or a framework like Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.
If you're using Bootstrap: the rows and columns of the grid must be wrapped in an element with a container class.<br>

**Responsiveness**<br>

Cross-Device Compatibility<br>

All content is responsive and displays on all display sizes. This includes:<br>

Desktop<br>
Mobile: Google Nexus 5<br>
Tablet: Apple iPad<br>
An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.<br>

TIP: Test responsiveness with Chrome Developer Tools device emulation by right-clicking anywhere on page, selecting ‘Inspect Element’, clicking the rectangle to the left of the Elements tab, select Apple iPad or Google Nexus 5 from Device drop-down list, and click reload.<br>

*Provide All Content*<br>
All content is rendered on all three devices. No content should be hidden on mobile devices.<br>

*Viewport meta Tag*<br>
Viewport meta tag is included in HTML. (i.e. <meta name=”viewport” …)<br>

*Responsive Images*<br>
If a CSS framework is used, classes provided by the CSS framework are used to make images responsive, otherwise media-queries are used to ensure responsiveness of images.<br>

*File structure*<br>
Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on functionality. For example:<br>
css/ for stylesheets<br>
img/ for images<br>
js/ for JavaScript files<br>
